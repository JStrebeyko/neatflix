This is my take on yet another recrutation task. This time, we will be creating something of a Netflix clone, with a special focus on its search functionality.

## Task Description

### User story
Through the web application the user has access to a list of TV shows in a “tile” view, where each “tile” consists of a poster/graphic of the given show, its title, release year and rating. After clicking on the “tile” additional details of the show appear. The user can also search for the shows by their title - limiting the number of displayed results (“tiles”) to those which contain the searched phrase.

## Takeaways
During this week's challange, as always we'll try to max out the expectations and learn along. Our side-quest this time is use the opportunity to use TS typing throughout (see if it is not too much of a burden for such a small project) and `@vue/composition-api` where possible.
